## Requirements

1. Clone the repo
2. Have your mongodb database up and running
3. Have your server running

### Technologies used:

- For Developement:

  - Nodejs(Latest version)
  - ExpressJs
  - MongoDb

- To run the solution, make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

- Use the following command in your terminal to initialize the applicationa and to install the necessary dependencies.

```
npm init -y
npm install
npm run dev or npm start
```

## Usage

- Clone the repo
- cd into the directory that you are in `Edustipend`.
- Create a project on mongodb and copy your MONGODB_URI
- Create a .env file at the root of the folder and include the following

```
- PORT

```

# Testing

- For API testing:
  - POSTMAN
  - Thunder Client
  - REST Client

**note**

- Make sure to specify the url correctly when making requests

### Routes

> The routes holds the 3 routes together for ease and simplicity.

const basePath = "/api/v1";

```
export default (app) => {
  app.use(`${basePath}/auth`, commentRouter);
  app.use(`${basePath}/users`, postRouter);
};

```
